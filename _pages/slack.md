# About
So a little while ago I made a Slack workspace because I was experimenting with adding an RSS feed of relevant fantasy data to my league's Slack channel. Things snowballed a bit as I kept adding more and more relevant feeds - until one day I just decided to make a "Dynasty News Slack Channel". It still works, and pulls relevant articles from a whole whack of quality sites:

- Rotoworld
- ESPN
- FantasyPros
- Pro Football Focus
- Football Outsiders
- PlayerProfiler
- Dynasty Football Factory
- Football Perspective
- The GridFe
- Sharp Football Analysis
- Predictive Football
- Matt Waldman RSP
- The Draft Network
- NumberFire

*I'll probably experiment with better ways of integrating all of these feeds at some point - maybe a few embedded RSS readers into this site would work better.*
