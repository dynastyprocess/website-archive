# Arbitrage App

###### *Created for DynastyProcess.com by [Joe Sydlowski](http://twitter.com/JoeSydlowskiFF)*

> *Which players are similar to X player, and are they cheaper or more expensive?*

### About
Inspired by similar projects found at [RotoViz](https://www.rotoviz.com), this app uses Euclidean distance-minimization to find the most similar five (or ten) players based on selected criteria from the [DynastyProcess database](/database). This, coupled with the FantasyPros consensus ranks, helps gives some objective data as to a) whether you should buy/sell a certain player and b) what alternatives you might have to them.

### Some Suggested Combinations

This tool is extremely flexible - you can search by literally as many or as few columns as you'd like.

If you're not sure which sets of data to start with, here are a few that Joe and I recommend as starting points for each position:

Position | Comparison Type | Variables
:---|:---:|:---
QB | general |  age, draftround, paATTs, AYA, ppr/g
RB| opportunity | draftround, ms_tgts, ruATTs, offSnapsPct
RB | efficiency | ruTDs, reTDs, ppr/g, adot
RB| athletic| age, height, forty, cone
WR| opportunity | draftround, wopr, adot, offSnapsPct
WR| efficiency | racr, reTDs ,ppr/g, adot
WR| athletic | age, height, forty, cone, shuttle
TE| opportunity | draftround, wopr, adot, offSnapsPct
TE| efficiency | racr, reTDs ,ppr/g, adot
TE | athletic | age, forty, cone, height, broad

Feel free to include any statistics that you might feel are relevant or predictive - and share any interesting comparisons with us!
