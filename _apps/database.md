## About

There are a lot of fantasy statistical databases available now, but very few (if any) are tailored to DynastyFF. This database is an attempt to aggregate the wide variety of information dynasty owners should have easy access to.

#### Already Connected
- FantasyPros ECR for dynasty and redraft
- 2018 AirYards.com data
- Spotrac contract data
- 2018 Snap Counts from Pro-Football-Reference
- Draft athletic data from RelativeAthleticScores.com (shoutout to Kent Lee Platte [@MathBomb](https://twitter.com/MathBomb))

...and because this database can't always aggregate every last source of data, it also includes playerIDs for MFL/Sleeper/nflGSIS/Rotoworld/ESPN/PFR IDs for easy extensions and additions!

#### Possible Extensions
- College Production Statistics (Dominator Ratings, Breakout Ages, Market Shares)
- Career Fantasy Statistics (Totals, per-game averages)
- Prospect Film Grades (NFL Draft Scout? NFL.com Prospect Grades?)
