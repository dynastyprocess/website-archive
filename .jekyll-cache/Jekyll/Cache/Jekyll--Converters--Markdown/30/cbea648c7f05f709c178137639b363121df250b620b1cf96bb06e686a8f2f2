<h3 id="what-is-the-depth-value-slider">What is the ‚ÄúDepth Value Slider‚Äù?</h3>
<p>One major problem with trade calculators is the idea that there is a universal number that describes how players should be valued relative to the others. I‚Äôm taking an initial stab at this problem by allowing you to play with the ‚Äúdepth‚Äù weighting. If your league values depth more (i.e. is a best ball league, has more starter, roster, or team spots than usual) you would move the slider to the left - and if your league values studs more, you would move the slider to the right. It‚Äôs preset to what we think might be a sensible default for standard 12 team PPR leagues, but your mileage may vary!</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-rookie-optimism-slider">What is the ‚ÄúRookie Optimism Slider‚Äù?</h3>

<p><em>We‚Äôve got a few more ideas on getting better at tweaking values, but we‚Äôd love to hear your suggestions!</em></p>

<h2 id="google-sheets-calculator">Google Sheets Calculator</h2>
<p>The now-deprecated Google Sheets calculator was the original ‚Äútrade calculator‚Äù developed by Tan (as part of the DynastyDashboard project). It‚Äôs still set up to receive automatic value updates (when we push a new values CSV to the GitHub, the Google Sheet pulls it in.)</p>
