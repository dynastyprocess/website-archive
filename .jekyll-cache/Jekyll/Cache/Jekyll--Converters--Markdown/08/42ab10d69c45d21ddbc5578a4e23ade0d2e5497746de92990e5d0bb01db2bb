<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>If you havenâ€™t heard me wax poetic about using potential points as being the best way to determine draft order, youâ€™re probably lucky :smirk:</p>

<p>In any case, these Excel sheets are made to help you calculate potential points for ESPN and Yahoo leagues (tested for 2018).</p>

<p><strong>They require Excel for Windows and the PowerQuery plugin</strong>. If youâ€™re not sure what that is, check out <a href="https://www.excelcampus.com/install-power-query/">ExcelCampusâ€™s guide here</a>.</p>
