<p>This page lists Excel workbooks, Google Sheets, and other resources that might be helpful for building more tools!</p>

<h2 id="databases">Databases</h2>

<p><a href="/database"><strong>DynastyProcess.com Database</strong></a> - an attempt to aggregate all possible sources of dynasty-relevant player-data. Also good for linking player IDs!</p>

<p><a href="/arbitrage"><strong>Arbitrage App</strong></a> - an app built to help find comparable players based on any criteria in the DynastyProcess database.</p>

<p><a href="/fpscrapes"><strong>FantasyPros Weekly Scrapes</strong></a> - this is a weekly scrape of FantasyPros ECR pages - eventually to be used for tracking risers and fallers!</p>

<h2 id="trade-calculators">Trade Calculators</h2>
<p><a href="/calculator"><strong>Trade Calculator</strong></a> - this is a simple Google Sheets-based trade calculator based on the Market Values sheet.</p>

<h2 id="player-values">Player Values</h2>

<p><a href="/values"><strong>Market Values</strong></a> - this is the classic set of DynastyDashboard values posted as a Google Sheet. Assumes standard dynasty formats. Algorithm is given so that you can tweak it to your liking - although no promises that your liking will match your leaguemates. Can be linked to other Google Sheets via IMPORTRANGE.</p>

<h2 id="draftauction-tools">Draft/Auction Tools</h2>

<p><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IJVXGFDVX4VDdc23Hlv6kRYzy9x0727hbZOERRoVY9U/copy">Startup Auction Helper</a></strong> - a Google Sheet designed to estimate approximate auction value of a player based on Market Values and amount of remaining budget. Inspired by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/u/slodanslodan">u/slodanslodan</a>’s sheet (all I did was tie it to my values sheet).</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tvFHSQPlxZyJP5l_CbmKXCDURIOqVzlpmSgM5wxQvKQ/copy">Rookie Draft Tracker</a></strong> - a Google sheet designed to help run an offline chat-based rookie draft (for the poor schmucks still on ESPN or Yahoo.) Keeps track of picks and crosses off names as players are taken. Set to view-only and share with league so that everyone’s on the same page.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TqGKcoJHTQqtC6pBBlKsDd8g24BVBkpsfug6z0QyK10/copy">Rookie Auction Tracker</a></strong> - similar to Rookie Draft Tracker but for rookie auctions held on a chat server. Keeps track of budget and players taken, set to view-only and share with league. No timer function is included - not a lot of great ways to do that cleanly, but I can work on it if someone really needs help.</p>

<p>More to come!</p>
