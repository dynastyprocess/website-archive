<p>So I was bored one day at work and decided that it‚Äôd be fun to build a tool to estimate the likelihood of winning the remaining weeks of the season. This tool calculates the likelihood of winning any given game as:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Team All Play Win % / (Team AP% + Opponent AP%) = Win Probability %</code></p>

<p>Summing this up for the remainder of the season and added to the existing win totals gives us the win projection.</p>

<p>I thought this was a useful way to give some insight into the playoff picture at midseason in a somewhat systematic way. It also gave me some opportunity to shit-talk my leaguemates. :smirk:</p>
