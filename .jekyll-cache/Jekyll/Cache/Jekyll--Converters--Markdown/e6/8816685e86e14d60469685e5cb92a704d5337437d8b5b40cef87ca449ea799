<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>So a little while ago I made a Slack workspace because I was experimenting with adding an RSS feed of relevant fantasy data to my league‚Äôs Slack channel. Things snowballed a bit as I kept adding more and more relevant feeds - until one day I just decided to make a ‚ÄúDynasty News Slack Channel‚Äù. It still works, and pulls relevant articles from a whole whack of quality sites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rotoworld</li>
  <li>ESPN</li>
  <li>FantasyPros</li>
  <li>Pro Football Focus</li>
  <li>Football Outsiders</li>
  <li>PlayerProfiler</li>
  <li>Dynasty Football Factory</li>
  <li>Football Perspective</li>
  <li>The GridFe</li>
  <li>Sharp Football Analysis</li>
  <li>Predictive Football</li>
  <li>Matt Waldman RSP</li>
  <li>The Draft Network</li>
  <li>NumberFire</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I‚Äôll probably experiment with better ways of integrating all of these feeds at some point - maybe a few embedded RSS readers into this site would work better.</em></p>
